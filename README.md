# image_recoqnition

This project is designed to show a few different ways of making image recoqnition in Python.

It is split up in 2 parts:
Part 1:
  Local python program showcasing recognition of simple shapes: Cross and Circle. The Cross will be match using image templates, allowing it to be implemented with other shapes if needed. The circle will be using a build-in method for looking after circles.

Part 2:
  Neural network application hosted on a google collab project running in the cloud. This application is making use of a trained tensorflow engine to differintiate between defferent objects.
  part 2.1:
    This is a standard out-of-the-box implementation of ResNet20v1 to train a neural network in the CIFAR-10 data set (The afforementioned external dataset from the synopsis). All credits for this part goes to the people who originally worked out the ResNet.
  part 2.2:
    This part being an implemented model trained by ResNet which can compare uploaded files to the CIFAR-10 dataset and give it's best bet at a classification.

How to run:
Part 1:
  Download the repo as a zip and run the image_proccesing.py using your preferred method.
